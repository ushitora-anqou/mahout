 * Schema Io_k8s_api_core_v1_aws_elastic_block_store_volume_source.t : Represents a Persistent Disk resource in AWS.  An AWS EBS disk must exist before mounting to a container. The disk must also be in the same AWS zone as the kubelet. An AWS EBS disk can only be mounted as read/write once. AWS EBS volumes support ownership management and SELinux relabeling.
