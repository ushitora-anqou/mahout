 * Schema Io_k8s_api_events_v1_event_series.t : EventSeries contain information on series of events, i.e. thing that was/is happening continuously for some time. How often to update the EventSeries is up to the event reporters. The default event reporter in \''k8s.io/client-go/tools/events/event_broadcaster.go\'' shows how this struct is updated on heartbeats and can guide customized reporter implementations.
