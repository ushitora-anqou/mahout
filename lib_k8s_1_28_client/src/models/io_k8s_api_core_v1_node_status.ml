Callers should instead use a full-replacement patch. See https://pr.k8s.io/79391 for an example. Consumers should assume that addresses can change during the lifetime of a Node. However, there are some exceptions where this may not be possible, such as Pods that inherit a Node's address in its own status or consumers of the downward API (status.hostIP). *)
