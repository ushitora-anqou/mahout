 * Schema Io_k8s_api_flowcontrol_v1beta2_exempt_priority_level_configuration.t : ExemptPriorityLevelConfiguration describes the configurable aspects of the handling of exempt requests. In the mandatory exempt configuration object the values in the fields here can be modified by authorized users, unlike the rest of the `spec`.

This is the number of execution seats nominally reserved for this priority level. This DOES NOT limit the dispatching from this priority level but affects the other priority levels through the borrowing mechanism. The server's concurrency limit (ServerCL) is divided among all the priority levels in proportion to their NCS values:  NominalCL(i)  = ceil( ServerCL * NCS(i) / sum_ncs ) sum_ncs = sum[priority level k] NCS(k)  Bigger numbers mean a larger nominal concurrency limit, at the expense of every other priority level.
