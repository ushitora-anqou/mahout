Each ResourceHandle contains data that should be passed to a specific kubelet plugin once it lands on a node.

Setting this field is optional. It has a maximum size of 32 entries. If null (or empty), it is assumed this allocation will be processed by a single kubelet plugin with no ResourceHandle data attached.
