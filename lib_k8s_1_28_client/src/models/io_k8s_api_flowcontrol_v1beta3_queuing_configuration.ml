The request is put into one of the shortest queues in that hand. `handSize` must be no larger than `queues`, and should be significantly smaller (so that a few heavy flows do not saturate most of the queues).  See the user-facing documentation for more extensive guidance on setting this field.  This field has a default value of 8. *)
