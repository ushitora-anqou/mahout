 * Schema Io_k8s_api_core_v1_endpoint_subset.t : EndpointSubset is a group of addresses with a common set of ports. The expanded set of endpoints is the Cartesian product of Addresses x Ports. For example, given:   {    Addresses: [{\''ip\'': \''10.10.1.1\''}, {\''ip\'': \''10.10.2.2\''}],    Ports:     [{\''name\'': \''a\'', \''port\'': 8675}, {\''name\'': \''b\'', \''port\'': 309}]  }  The resulting set of endpoints can be viewed as:   a: [ 10.10.1.1:8675, 10.10.2.2:8675 ],  b: [ 10.10.1.1:309, 10.10.2.2:309 ]
