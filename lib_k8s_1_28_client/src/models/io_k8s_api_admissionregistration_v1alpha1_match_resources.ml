For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, but \''rules\'' only included `apiGroups:[\''apps\''], apiVersions:[\''v1\''], resources: [\''deployments\'']`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would not be sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.  - Equivalent: match a request if modifies a resource listed in rules, even via another API group or version. For example, if deployments can be modified via apps/v1, apps/v1beta1, and extensions/v1beta1, and \''rules\'' only included `apiGroups:[\''apps\''], apiVersions:[\''v1\''], resources: [\''deployments\'']`, a request to apps/v1beta1 or extensions/v1beta1 would be converted to apps/v1 and sent to the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy.  Defaults to \''Equivalent\'' *)
