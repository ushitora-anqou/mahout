A binding is invalid if spec.paramRef.name refers to a non-existent resource.  failurePolicy does not define how validations that evaluate to false are handled.

    (* MatchConditions is a list of conditions that must be met for a request to be validated. Match conditions filter requests that have already been matched by the rules, namespaceSelector, and objectSelector. An empty list of matchConditions matches all requests. There are a maximum of 64 match conditions allowed.  If a parameter object is provided, it can be accessed via the `params` handle in the same manner as validation expressions.  The exact matching logic is (in order):   1. If ANY matchCondition evaluates to FALSE, the policy is skipped.   2. If ALL matchConditions evaluate to TRUE, the policy is evaluated.   3. If any matchCondition evaluates to an error (but none are FALSE):      - If failurePolicy=Fail, reject the request      - If failurePolicy=Ignore, the policy is skipped *)

The variables defined here will be available under `variables` in other expressions of the policy except MatchConditions because MatchConditions are evaluated before the rest of the policy.  The expression of a variable can refer to other variables defined earlier in the list but not those after. Thus, Variables must be sorted by the order of first appearance and acyclic. *)
